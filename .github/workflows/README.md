# Kam Workflows

This directory contains the shared workflow baseline used by Kam module
repositories.

## init.yml

`init.yml` validates the repository. It runs on `push`, `pull_request`, and
manual `workflow_dispatch`.

It checks out submodules, installs Kam with `MemDeco-WG/setup-kam@v3`, then
runs:

```bash
kam validate
kam check
```

It also runs `shellcheck` over shell files under `hooks/`, `src/`, and the
top-level `kam.sh` when they exist.

## exec.yml

`exec.yml` builds the module. It runs on `push`, `pull_request`, and manual
`workflow_dispatch`.

Dispatch on `main` with `bump=patch`, `minor`, or `major` to prepare a version PR.
For example, `v1.3.9` becomes `v1.3.10`, `v1.4.0`, or `v2.0.0`, respectively.
All three metadata files (`kam.toml`, `src/MagicNet/module.prop`, `update.json`)
are updated together and `versionCode` increases by one. This run creates the PR
without building the module. With `bump=none`, the workflow builds the existing
committed version and can publish it when `release=true`.

With a bump, `release=true` adds a release request so merging the PR builds and
publishes it. `prerelease=true` is preserved in that request and requires
`release=true`. A version-only PR builds without publishing after merge.

Each target version uses a dedicated `automation/release-vX.Y.Z` branch. Repeated
requests update the same PR; do not edit that generated branch manually. Reruns
whose original commit is no longer the head of main fail and require a new
dispatch. Version updates never push directly to the protected branch.

PR creation uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` with job-scoped `contents: write` and
`pull-requests: write`. The repository must allow Actions to create pull requests.
On failure, the workflow verifies the pushed branch's complete tree and base commit.
A matching branch produces a warning and a summary link to create the PR manually;
a missing or mismatched branch still fails. This supports repositories that disable
Actions PR creation without changing their permissions. The version branch is only
prepared at this point; publishing still requires merging its release request. Bot-created
PR workflow runs may await approval by someone with write access. Approve pending
runs on the PR page, review, and merge normally; this workflow does not approve
or merge its own PRs.

There are two ways to publish after review:

- Include `.github/release-request` in the version PR, with the exact version
  on the first line, for example `v1.3.9`. Merging it into `main` requests a release
  only when that file changed in the triggering push's `before..sha` range.
  The file remains in the repository; later pushes that leave it unchanged
  do not request another release. Update it to the next exact version for
  the next release. An optional second line, `prerelease=true`, requests a
  prerelease. Single-line version markers remain supported; the previous `patch`
  marker is no longer supported.
  A push that rewrote `main` (amend or rebase) has no comparable previous tip in
  the checkout, so the workflow warns and stays build-only instead of guessing a
  release from an unverifiable range.
- Merge the version PR, then dispatch `exec.yml` on `main` with `release=true`.
  Set `prerelease=true` to mark a manually requested release as a prerelease.
  Keep `bump=none`; the committed version tag must not already exist.

Pull requests and ordinary pushes build and upload workflow artifacts without
publishing a release. When `KAM_PRIVATE_KEY` is available, the uploaded artifact
also includes the module signature sidecar.

Release checks require matching committed version metadata,
a matching release-request version when used, and a new tag and release.
Publishing requires signing and successful artifact and installation checks.
The release tag targets the exact `GITHUB_SHA` that was built. Existing tags
or releases are rejected; release assets are never overwritten.

### Build caches

Go module downloads and compiled packages are cached with keys covering the Go
version, NDK, module lockfiles, fork revision, and build-script inputs. A new fork
revision restores compatible previous entries and saves an updated cache after a
successful job, avoiding a permanently frozen cache keyed only by `go.sum`.

Rust caches include registry/git dependencies and `target/`. Module and quality
jobs have separate namespaces; keys include the compiler, lockfile/configuration,
and workspace sources, plus the NDK for Android builds. Restore prefixes retain
compatible dependency outputs across source and lockfile changes. Cargo still
checks fingerprints; the workflow never skips compilation based only on a cache hit.

`cargo-ndk` is pinned and cached in its own install directory; exact hits skip
`cargo install`. Node/npm and Bun download caches cover either WebUI package
manager. Tests, type checks, packaging, signatures, and smoke tests still run.
No final release ZIP or signing key is included in these new caches.

Only Kam's own cache is enabled in setup-kam. Its whole-`~/.rustup` cache is
disabled so it cannot overwrite a freshly installed Rust toolchain. Android
standard libraries are installed normally without deleting toolchain directories;
only the module's required `aarch64-linux-android` Rust target is installed.
The first run populates the new namespaces; real speedups depend on later hits.

## quality.yml

`quality.yml` keeps code-level checks independent from packaging:

- Rust: formatting, Clippy with warnings denied, and workspace tests using locked dependencies and all targets/features.
- Shell: `bash scripts/lint-shell.sh` checks host tooling and first-party device scripts, including sourced runtime fragments. `bash scripts/test-host.sh` runs fixture-based regressions.
- WebUI: `npm ci` installs locked dependencies; `npm run check` runs tests, Vue component type checking with `vue-tsc`, and the build. After Chromium installation, `npm run test:ui` covers phone, landscape and desktop layouts, modal focus, keyboard clearance and draft retention. Browser fixtures do not access a device.

Local `scripts/pre-commit.sh` reuses these entrypoints and passes
`--with-routing-assets` to include the routing/DNS integration tests that require
a host sing-box binary and prepared rule sets. The CI fixture suite excludes
those two checks. Device, packaging, and installation checks remain separate.

## Local Customization

Keep this shared baseline generic. Put project-specific workflows in additional
files; `kam sync workflow` preserves extra workflow files.
