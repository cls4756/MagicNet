# v1.5.1

- Reject empty, malformed and multi-document JSON before atomically replacing a
  config; preserve the original on generator/sanitizer failures.
- Keep a private, core-validated recovery checkpoint containing the configuration
  and nodes. Recover a broken config even when the subscription URL and disposable
  node cache are unavailable; reject mode-mismatched or invalid checkpoints.
- Bound config-lock waits when a marker-less lock directory cannot be reclaimed;
  never delete foreign entries to force acquisition (#254).
- Keep Google and other maintained service selectors following `proxy` by default
  instead of accidentally pinning them to the first subscription node. Preserve
  explicit valid choices across refresh and never automatically fall back to direct.
- Add fault-injection regressions and a mandatory real-core loopback routing check
  in every module build. Google Play end-to-end behavior on the reported Android
  device remains to be confirmed; #253 is not claimed fully resolved by host tests.

# v1.4.9 (2026-09-14)

- Move the reusable downloader installer template into KAM 0.6.14 and publish
  `magicnet_installer.zip` with each MagicNet release.
- Installer downloads are verified against GitHub's release SHA-256, ZIP CRC,
  and module ID, then cached under `/data/adb/cache/{module_id}` for incremental
  updates.
- Protect Google, Google Play, Gemini, YouTube, and Android API routes in the
  maintained sing-box service configuration.

Installer download: `https://github.com/LIghtJUNction/MagicNet/releases/latest/download/magicnet_installer.zip`

## Unreleased

- Add HTTP/HTTPS proxy nodes to the native subscription parser (share links and
  Clash `type: http`), including paired credentials and optional TLS.
- Forward the sniffed domain to outbounds so a proxy node can route by domain,
  controlled by a default-on switch (`cli domain-forward`, WebUI tools page).
  The override is TCP-only; UDP keeps the IP path. An enabled switch on a core
  without the fork option reports `configured=enabled`/`effective=unsupported`
  instead of writing a key the core would reject.
- Land the required core change as `sing-box-patches/` plus
  `scripts/apply-sing-box-patches.sh`. When a domain-based dial fails, the fork
  retries once with the original IP address and keeps the original return path.
- Project domain-forwarding intent, core capability and materialized state into
  `domain-forward.state`, and expose `cli --json domain-forward status`.
- Fix the domain-forward capability probe: it matched the bare
  `override_destination` field name, which a stock sing-box still carries inside
  its inbound `sniff_override_destination` option. Every unpatched core was
  reported as capable and then received a key it refuses to decode, so the core
  exited at startup and the dataplane stayed down. The probe now matches the
  fork's JSON struct tag and then asks the installed core to decode a probe
  document; a core that rejects the key stays `configured=enabled` with
  `effective=unsupported` and keeps a loadable configuration.
- Build the core from the `cls4756/magicnet-sing-box` fork, whose
  `magicnet-domain-forward` branch carries the `override_destination` patch, and
  pin that revision in the parent gitlink.
- Show installed app names and icons in the WebUI app policy list: rows and
  already-selected entries label the package through the KernelSU package API,
  icons come from `ksu://icon/<package>`, and the search box matches app names
  as well as package names. Managers without the package API keep the previous
  package-name-only view instead of inventing labels.
- Visualize Proxy, Direct, and Bypass app traffic paths in the WebUI, including
  DNS boundaries, before/after confirmation details, automatic activation, and
  an advanced action to re-resolve Android UIDs after package or user changes.
- Remove the in-repository MagicBox Android app, its submodule integration,
  App-only documentation, and policy-test coupling.
- Keep eBPF in hybrid mode by default, preserving local cgroup interception while shared TC waits for a confirmed downstream interface.
- Report eBPF `hybrid` as ready while shared TC still waits for a confirmed
  downstream interface. Readiness demanded a non-empty shared interface list, so
  the default eBPF configuration showed the service as not ready even though the
  local cgroup path was attached and traffic was proxied. A configured downstream
  interface without its TC attachment is still reported as not ready.
- Fix Android supervisor discovery on OEM processes with malformed `/proc` cmdlines, bound all PID lookups by one deadline, and reclaim dead refresh metadata safely.
- Preserve explicit TUN/eBPF managed inbound settings across mode switches and recover interrupted transparent journals before fswatch applies a config.
- Add a configurable HTTPS Git repository for the sing-box config template, defaulting to a pinned `LIghtJUNction/MagicSingBox` commit and digest with atomic validation and rollback.
- Replace the verbose first-run guide with a single subscription input accepting one source per line without persisting the raw draft.
- Route maintained WeChat destination IPs through `cn-direct` so push long
  connections do not fall through to the proxy after domain information is lost.
- Fix #121 by clearing the zero-node bootstrap selector cache after the first successful subscription import so populated proxy groups cannot remain pinned to `block`.
- Fix #119 by propagating CLI parent death to privileged workers, preserving subscription rollback traps, bounding status lock recovery, and reconciling interrupted transactions during startup.
- Fix #115 by aligning config-editor template sync with the packaged MagicSingBox routing baseline, removing the stale FakeIP blackhole and restoring early X domain ownership.
- Select the policy-compatible AliDNS HTTPS bootstrap without blocking startup on live Internet probes.
- Make manual sing-box lifecycle actions responsive by bounding config-lock waits, detaching optional supervisors, deduplicating post-start materialization and hotspot discovery, and avoiding needless DNS guard cleanup loops.
- Resolve WeChat and Tencent media domains with local DNS and route them directly so image CDN requests keep regional affinity and avoid slow proxy fallthrough.
- Restrict hotspot routing to discovered tether subnets so ordinary private-address Wi-Fi traffic cannot bypass app and domain routing rules.
- Fix APatch fswatch startup by probing root-tool BusyBox locking helpers and keeping an optional watcher failure from masking a healthy sing-box restart.
- Fix the eBPF Dataplane health item on real devices. A complete
  `tools ebpf status --json` report carries one finding per required kernel
  feature and is several times larger than the 4 KiB capture other diagnostics
  use, so a healthy probe was truncated and reported as
  `probe=capability:failed({...})` while the core was serving traffic normally.
  The probe now has its own capture budget and summarises the report as
  `ok result=supported findings=N required=0`, or as a bounded failure token
  that names the first required failing feature instead of dumping raw JSON.

## v1.2.11 (2026-08-11)

- Add a configurable sing-box two-hop proxy chain with manual or automatic
  exit selection, CLI controls, persisted policy, and Zashboard selector
  integration.
- Fix hotspot proxy sharing by dynamically discovering tether interfaces and
  subnets, routing tethered IPv4 traffic into `magicnet0`, and reconciling the
  policy when Android creates, removes, or renumbers the hotspot interface.
- Restore the X/Twitter DNS ownership rule and harden packaged subscription and
  route configuration updates against partial writes.
- Keep repeated runtime configuration application idempotent while preserving
  selector connection-interruption semantics.
- Pin transitive WebUI `nanoid` to `3.3.17` to remediate Dependabot alert #3
  (GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8 / CVE-2026-67213).

- Import `socks://` and `socks5://` nodes natively with validated optional
  authentication, and preserve independent VMess WebSocket path, Host, server,
  and SNI fields through sing-box outbound generation.
- Refresh release, onboarding, user, MCP, simulation, architecture, and
  embedded kamfw documentation around the current TUN-only workflow.
- Delegate sing-box outbound interface changes to Android instead of relying on
  default-interface auto-detection that can fail on Android 16 policy routes.
- Disable Android tether offload while hotspot Proxy is enabled, then restore
  the previous system value when disabled or uninstalled so tethered traffic
  cannot bypass the TUN through vendor hardware/BPF forwarding.
- Discover Android tether interfaces dynamically and install reversible
  `ip rule` entries ahead of the OEM tethering rule so hotspot clients reach
  the `magicnet0` TUN even when the OEM changes the SoftAP subnet.
- Fix #93 by accepting validated standalone sing-box JSON configs and imported
  Clash YAML, base64, share-link, JSON, or text subscription files as local
  startup sources without requiring a subscription URL, with atomic URL/local
  switching and rollback.
- Batch-assign selected installed apps with one confirmation, policy write,
  and core restart.
- Resolve configured app packages to per-user Android UIDs so Bypass TUN and
  whitelist policies install effective kernel routing exclusions instead of
  relying on package-name fields alone.
- Exempt Bypass TUN UIDs from MagicNet's DNS capture chain so opted-out apps
  keep DNS and application traffic on the same native network path instead of
  accumulating sing-box DNS exchange timeouts.
- Wait for fswatch and the other supervisors before service start/restart
  returns, preventing a transient stopped warning after the core is ready.
- Decode JSON Unicode escapes in native VMess share-link names.
- Coordinate userspace Tailscale endpoints with `magicnet0`, preserve endpoints across template
  sync, protect one-time auth keys, and expose route/state health evidence.
- Reapply subscription keyword filters while sanitizing cached/generated
  outbounds so filtered nodes cannot survive through a repair or cache replay.
- Order every AI selector with United States nodes first, Japan second, and
  other eligible regions afterward, while excluding mainland China, Hong Kong,
  and Taiwan labels from all AI groups.

## v1.1.27 (2026-07-28)

- Add a persistent custom User-Agent for subscription downloads, configurable
  from the CLI and WebUI and applied consistently by curl and wget.
- Fix #64 by keeping Android network validation on the automatic healthy-node
  group when the general proxy selector is pinned to a manual node, preventing
  a stalled node from making the system mark Wi-Fi as disconnected.
- Keep ChatGPT remote pairing feature traffic on the pinned ChatGPT path and
  route all X Android action requests before the FakeIP guard.
- Start each AI service selector on its filtered service-specific automatic
  failover group after a subscription provides eligible nodes, while keeping
  zero-node configurations blocked and preserving explicit user selections.
- Resolve WeChat media uploads through the local DNS path and route Tencent
  media domains before the FakeIP loop guard, while preserving Clash mode and
  destination-specific policy precedence.
- Include the redacted startup blocker in support bundles so stopped-core issue
  reports distinguish missing subscriptions or nodes from runtime crashes.
- Add line numbers, JSON syntax highlighting, and live JSON syntax checks to the
  configuration editor.
- Remove the built-in supporter leaderboard.
- Clarify the supported sing-box + `magicnet0` TUN runtime and align device
  diagnostics with `cli transparent status`, `cli health`, and the available
  CLI contract.

## v1.1.23 (2026-07-19)

- Give ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Claude independent `urltest` automatic
  failover while keeping their selectors fail-closed.
- Make first subscription activation atomic, recover interrupted transactions
  from a journal, reuse the SHA-256 identity cache, and serialize owner-safe
  scheduled and manual refreshes.
- Rework the WebUI for first-time and subsequent subscription setup plus refresh
  scheduling, surface structured errno details, produce a single redacted issue
  report per failure, and polish desktop and mobile layouts.

## v1.1.22 (2026-07-17)

- Fix #46 by retrying a failed direct subscription download through the local
  sing-box mixed proxy only when its API confirms that the owned service is
  available; explicit proxy configuration remains fail-closed.

## v1.1.21 (2026-07-16)

- Fix #44 by removing DNS capture and leak-guard rules whenever the core stops,
  keeping runtime configuration inert while stopped, and clearing stale rules
  before subscription refresh or kernel startup.
- Route the dedicated `magicnet-dns-in` listener directly to `hijack-dns`
  without requiring protocol sniffing before the DNS rule can match.
- Add default direct bypasses for Xianyu, Taobao, Pinduoduo, Meituan, Ctrip,
  and Railway 12306 in blacklist app-routing mode.

## v1.1.20 (2026-07-14)

- Add an independent non-China/Hong Kong `ai-proxy` selector and route the
  ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Claude selectors through it while remaining
  fail-closed by default.
- Persist selector choices across subscription activation and service restarts.
- Fetch subscriptions directly by default, with bounded downloader and process
  timeouts plus owner-aware update and configuration locks.
- Make subscription activation transactional and restart only the verified
  owned sing-box process, restoring the previous configuration on failure.

## v1.1.19 (2026-07-14)

- Repair legacy sing-box subscription configurations that are missing the
  fail-closed ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Claude outbound selectors.
- Validate cached AI selectors across jq and no-jq paths, rejecting malformed,
  duplicate, or stale outbound references before rebuilding the subscription.

## v1.1.18 (2026-07-13)

- Fix #40 by normalizing pasted HTTP(S) URLs in the WebUI to canonical hostnames
  and canonicalizing valid CLI allow-rule inputs while rejecting invalid or unsupported values.
- Migrate legacy scheme-bearing `ad-allow` rules atomically and idempotently,
  validated with real-device A/B tests of the allow and block paths.

## v1.1.17 (2026-07-13)

- Fix #36 by making `ad-allow` inherit the normal `final` policy by default,
  while preserving explicit Direct and Proxy overrides across bundled, jq,
  no-jq, and upgrade-generated configurations.
- Fix #37 by adding a high-priority package rule for Proxy-listed apps and
  restarting sing-box after app policy changes so the selected policy takes
  effect immediately.
- Update Proxy/Bypass lists transactionally during multi-app changes to avoid
  partially applied policy state.

## v1.1.16 (2026-07-12)

- Fix #34 with an explicit delete action for ad allowlist chips, and refresh
  blocklist state after removal so community rules return to the community list
  while manually added entries do not.

## v1.1.15 (2026-07-11)

- Add a prioritized ad allowlist routed through selectable `direct` or `proxy`
  outbounds, make `ad-block` selectable between `block`, `direct`, and `proxy`,
  and expose allowlist rule management in the WebUI.
- Add independent fail-closed `ai-chatgpt`, `ai-gemini`, `ai-grok`, and
  `ai-claude` selectors pinned only to explicit eligible nodes.
- Exclude mainland China and Hong Kong labels, including Hong Kong variants and
  standalone `HK` or `HKG`, from pinned AI selectors without boundary false
  positives.

## v1.1.14 (2026-07-11)

- Set the managed sing-box TUN MTU to 1400 to mitigate slow uploads.
- Generate compact, size-bounded unified diffs for configuration issues instead
  of embedding truncated full configurations in issue URLs.
- Use fail-closed structural redaction so node endpoints, credentials, and
  arbitrary private configuration values cannot leak into issue drafts.

## v1.1.13 (2026-07-11)

- Fix #24 by allowing long mobile WebUI text to scroll horizontally while
  preserving page zoom and pinch gestures.
- Keep the top WebUI controls on a single line with a compact narrow-screen
  layout.
- Move the KAM dev staging path to `/sdcard/Download/MagicNet`.

## v1.1.12 (2026-07-10)

- Add a WebUI control workspace with functional diagnostic and configuration
  preview tools.
- Recover routing after interface changes, and improve CLI backup and help
  flows plus default node handling.
- Update the bundled Zashboard revision.
- Preserve AnyTLS and TUIC nodes during subscription imports, with packaged
  regression coverage.
- Remove tracked local runtime state from the repository.

## v1.1.11 (2026-06-30)

- Avoid manager/non-TTY install hangs by skipping MagicNet interactive prompts
  unless the installer has a real TTY.
- Add install smoke coverage for manager-style installs with
  `MAGICNET_NONINTERACTIVE` unset.
- Route Google China traffic through `proxy` and update the KAM framework
  submodule to the fetchable language install revision.
- Document how to add nodes through WebUI subscriptions or `cli setup`.

## v1.1.10 (2026-06-26)

- Fix multi-subscription share-link aggregation so proxylink sees every source
  before import.
- Fall back when proxylink emits fewer valid nodes than the extractor
  collected, instead of reporting a misleadingly short list.
- Refresh node list cache and current-config parsing to avoid stale node counts
  and other misleading summaries.
- Remove stale runtime packaging flags from the module artifact and document
  that runtime executables belong in `bin/`, not legacy `.local/bin`.
- Simplify generated sing-box subscription selectors by removing fixed region
  buckets such as `hk` and `jp`; imported nodes now stay under `proxy` and
  rule selectors point to `proxy` or `direct`.
- Speed up sing-box startup by treating a stable sing-box process as ready
  instead of waiting for the Clash/WebUI API port.

## v1.1.9 (2026-06-26)

- Capture Android system DNS queries on port 53 into a local sing-box DNS
  inbound so app traffic is not seeded with carrier-poisoned domain answers.
- Keep the DNS capture chain removable when MagicNet is disabled and skip it
  for the UDP Cloudflare DNS profile to avoid self-redirect loops.

## v1.1.8 (2026-06-21)

- Remove eBPF, TProxy, and non-TUN transparent mode support from the runtime,
  CLI, WebUI, MCP schema, build pipeline, and smoke tests.
- Keep MagicNet on the single stable `sing-box` + `magicnet0` TUN path.

## v1.1.7 (2026-06-21)

- Refine eBPF transparent mode into a TCP bridge profile with TUN kept as the
  compatibility fallback for UDP-sensitive traffic.
- Remove the unfinished UDP bridge/TProxy main path and keep only migration
  cleanup for stale UDP TProxy chains.
- Split large eBPF and diagnostics modules so individual source files stay
  below 500 lines and the TCP/eBPF health checks are easier to audit.

## v1.1.6 (2026-06-20)

- Add a WebUI issue creation action that copies the full diagnostic context to
  the clipboard and opens a short prefilled GitHub issue URL.
- Sanitize sing-box subscription fields before JSON emission so CR/LF control
  characters from provider data cannot break generated configs.
- Fix the CLI health check for sing-box DoH servers that use IP addresses with
  `tls.server_name`, avoiding a false `remote_dns_detour=missing` warning.
- Skip local sing-box subscription refresh during normal startup when cached
  nodes are already present, so the core starts immediately and provider-specific
  downloads are left to the core or explicit subscription update commands.

## v1.1.5 (2026-06-14)

- Package runtime executables under `bin/`, including the
  `cli -> bin/magicnet-cli` compatibility entry.
- Add a config editor action to sync the latest upstream mihomo and sing-box
  templates from their template repositories while preserving subscription
  provider/node configuration.
- Add sing-box REDIRECT inbound generation for local TCP capture in TProxy mode
  and verify the paired NAT OUTPUT REDIRECT data path in the fake Magisk smoke.
- Keep sing-box sniff inbound lists aligned with the active transparent mode.
- Add closed-loop local, AVD, and physical-device validation for hotspot shared
  proxy rules, sing-box, mihomo, and VPN coexistence.
- Force subscription refresh before starting sing-box or mihomo and refuse to
  boot with stale cached nodes when the refresh fails.
- Refresh WebUI dependency locks after the esbuild advisory bump.

## v1.1.4 (2026-06-11)

- Show a default `premium_a` mihomo provider slot when config templates do not
  define proxy-providers yet, so WebUI subscription entry is always available.
- Create the missing mihomo `proxy-providers` section when saving a subscription
  and make missing-subscription startup errors point to the exact setup command.
- Let the config editor load a minimal editable template when the real config is
  missing, and rename the hotspot rule button to “重新加载”.

## v1.1.3 (2026-06-11)

- Refine kamfw console output by replacing emoji and decorative status marks
  with concise bracket labels for logs, panels, and volume-key prompts.

## v1.1.2 (2026-06-11)

- Build and package the Vue WebUI during `kam build` so the module archive
  always contains `webroot/index.html` and frontend assets.
- Remove unused standalone hotspot and VPN coexistence wrapper scripts; the
  runtime functions remain wired through MagicNet startup/config flows.

## v1.1.0 (2026-06-03)

- Use `magicnet0` as the default MagicNet virtual interface name for both
  sing-box and mihomo templates, avoiding collisions with generic `tun0` used
  by other VPN clients.
- Document the Rust CLI and MCP server layout under `bin/`, while keeping
  `/data/adb/modules/MagicNet/cli` as the stable compatibility entry.
- Add CLI-managed subscription updates for sing-box and mihomo providers,
  hotspot proxy/direct switching, transparent mode switching, watchdog
  diagnostics, and safer support bundle guidance.
- Refresh README feature docs for the management WebUI, TUN/TProxy modes,
  `magicnet0` diagnostics, hotspot forwarding, VPN coexistence, and dev checks.

## v1.0.38 (2026-06-02)

- Fix hotspot forwarding detection on devices that expose hotspot as a `wlan*`
  interface with a private address in Android's `local_network` route table
  instead of a conventional `.1` gateway address.

## v1.0.37 (2026-06-02)

- Fix VPN coexistence by moving sing-box TUN from the generic `tun0` name to
  `magicnet0`, avoiding interface-name collisions with other VPN clients.
- Enable VPN coexistence handling by default and apply external VPN bypass rules
  before sing-box auto-route interception.
- Keep subscription restart cleanup compatible with both `magicnet0` and legacy
  `tun0` runtime interfaces.
- Route Google, YouTube, AMP, and related domains explicitly through the proxy
  before CN rule sets can match them as direct.

## v1.0.36 (2026-06-02)

- Fix sing-box TUN loopback on Android by using gVisor auto-redirect and binding
  outbound traffic to the detected physical default interface before startup.
- Route Google connectivity checks through the proxy path while keeping Microsoft
  connectivity checks direct.
- Avoid generating unsupported uTLS settings for imported hysteria2 share links.
- Stop sing-box by exact daemon PID instead of `pkill -f`, preventing module
  action shells from killing themselves during restart.
